oss-mytracks
============

Mirror of Google MyTracks, which got updated with a "we will remove these sources on 1/1/15 and we're not updating the OSS version anymore" message around October 16th 2014.
The Message in Question: "We no longer update the open source version of My Tracks, and we will remove these sources after 1/1/15."

This is the sad end of MyTracks.
It still exists, but as a closed-source, Material Design app, that removed the API and the ability to share files outside of Drive.
And that pretty much sums up where Android is heading: Closed Source. :(
